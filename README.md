## About
Mobile App
The purpose of this repository is to write code for both Front-End and Back-End development. For the Front-End, we will be using React-Native to develop our mobile app for visuals and interactions with the users to see. We will also be using Restful API in order to make request and responses between the Front-End and the Back-End. For 3rd party services, we were also planning to use Twilio to build communications like sending text messages to a randomly generated cell phone number. Now for Back-End, we're planning to use Django/Python to connect the Front-End when users are making API request from the client side and then get the response back from our Back-End. For Database, we're planning to use MongoDB in order to store each specific users credentials when they login to our app. To test our mobile app, we'll be using Firebase to host our app on the cloud for testing.
